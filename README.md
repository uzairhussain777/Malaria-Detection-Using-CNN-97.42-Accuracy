Data Collection:
Dataset was collected from the GitHub repository [37. https://github.com/tobsecret/Awesome_Malaria_Parasite_Imaging_Datasets] and from kaggle [38. https://www.kaggle.com/dharun/malaria-bbbc], and dataset contains 34,625 parasites images, their types are Vivax, Falciparum Ovale, Malariae, and their species are ring, Trophozoite, Schizont, Gametocyte and Leukocyte. [37] contains malaria plasmodium types i.e. falciparum, vivax, malariae and ovale parasites, while [38] contains all species of malaria that are ring, Leukocyte, Gametocyte, Trophozoite, Schizont. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels for the training, testing and classification reason using three RGB color. Figure 1 represents different types of malaria parasite and its species.
